# üß† Digit Predictor with PyTorch & C++ Inference

Welcome to **Digit Predictor** ‚Äì a simple but cool demo that shows how to train a PyTorch model in Python and run it in fast C++!  

It's not production code ‚Äì just a **toy example** to help you get started with native inference using TorchScript. It‚Äôs great for learning how to bridge Python & C++.

## üõ†Ô∏è What‚Äôs Inside?

- ‚úÖ A **PyTorch** training script (Python)
- ‚úÖ A **C++ inference** program using **LibTorch**
- ‚úÖ Preprocessing with OpenCV
- ‚úÖ Digit classification from 28√ó28 grayscale images (MNIST-style) with simple CNN
- ‚úÖ TorchScript serialization

## üß™ Prerequisites

To make things smooth, I **recommend** the following setup:

| Component       | Version         |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Python         | 3.8+            |
| PyTorch        | **2.5.1**       |
| LibTorch (C++) | **2.5.1 CPU**   |
| OpenCV (C++)   | Any recent      |
| Compiler       | MSVC            |

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your **LibTorch and PyTorch versions match exactly**. Mismatched versions may cause cryptic errors. 
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Also I used a debug CPU version of LibTorch.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è And don't forget to create a virtual environment: 
```bash
‚¶Å python -m venv torch_venv
‚¶Å Source torch_venv/scripts/activate
‚¶Å pip install torch torchvision torchaudio 
```

## üßë‚Äçüè´ How It Works

### 1. üîß Train & Save the Model (Python)

Run the training script to:

- Train a basic CNN on MNIST
- Export it as a TorchScript `.pt` file
- Save the model in **CPU format** for C++ inference

```bash
cd training
python train.py
```

This creates **model_cpu.pt** in your working directory.

Training losses look like this:

### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Run Inference (C++)
Build soulution using CMake. 
Before that you should download LibTorch and OpenCV for C++.

Afterwards, in CMAKE-UI configure and generate a solution.

Compile and run the C++ program using Visual Studio. It will:
- Load the model using torch::jit::load
- Read a 28√ó28 grayscale image, preprocess it
- Run prediction
- Print the predicted digit
- You are awesome!
